Version 2.4.1 marks the 10th anniversary of ImageViewer and introduces a significant overhaul, packed with new features and a refreshed user interface. The old screenshot is kept as a nostalgic nod to the app’s earlier days:

This update was substantial enough that it nearly warranted a leap to version 3.0 instead of 2.4.

For a comprehensive list of changes introduced in v2.4, refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/SpaceDandy-Tama/ImageViewer/releases/tag/v2.4).

With this update, ImageViewer is now more powerful, stable, and user-friendly than ever.
